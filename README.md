# MBM-Flex

MultiBox-Flexible Model (MBM-Flex) is an indoor air quality model. It was developed as part of the **IAQ-EMS** project, a component of the [UK Clean Air Programme](https://www.ukcleanair.org/). The aim of MBM-Flex is to provide the community with a flexible tool to simulate and investigate indoor air quality and its health impacts.

MBM-Flex is a Python-based multi-room box-model for indoor air chemistry and transport. It integrates chemical mechanisms, configurable room layouts, and simulation runners (CLI and simple UI), and includes tools for extracting and analysing outputs.

## Model description

MBM-Flex is built upon the [INCHEM-Py](https://github.com/DrDaveShaw/INCHEM-Py/) indoor chemical box-model. INCHEM-Py is designed to simulate air quality inside a single room, while MBM-Flex is designed to simulate air quality inside a number of interconnected rooms or an entire building. 

To do so, MBM-Flex runs separate instances of INCHEM-Py for each per-room chemistry in piecewise time intervals. Between intervals it both adjusts the properties of a room which would otherwise be fixed; and interconnects the instances with an implementation of inter-room transport.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+ and pip.

**Install dependencies:**
+ numpy
+ numba
+ pandas
+ tqdm
+ scipy
+ threadpoolctl
+ matplotlib
+ multiprocess

**Acquire inchempy**

Initially the `inchempy/` folder is empty. A complete version of [INCHEM-Py](https://github.com/DrDaveShaw/INCHEM-Py/) needs to be downloaded and copied into this folder.

As of January 26, the only commit of INCHEM-Py guaranteed to work is [INCHEM-Py Commit 116cb71](https://github.com/DrDaveShaw/INCHEM-Py/tree/116cb71562b32baaa86c58f9c090d94491a4fa41) . The mainline of INCHEM-Py **does not work**.
This is due to its management of memory. We hope future versions of INCHEM-Py will become compatible.
You can download this precise version [here](https://github.com/DrDaveShaw/INCHEM-Py/archive/116cb71562b32baaa86c58f9c090d94491a4fa41.zip).

**Run a sample simulation:**

```bash
# Basic run (runs the building configuration defined in the config_rooms/ folder)
python run_mbm.py
```
This will run the example simulation defined in the `config_rooms/` folder.
It produces a pkl binary file with the results contained and dataframes for the different rooms. 

**Extract results / post-process:**

```bash
python MBM_extractor.py
```
This will extract the pkl file you have generated into plots & csv files of subsets of the results.

**Optional - Run the simple UI:**

```bash
python run_mbm_ui.py
```
Here you can assemble the skeleton of a building and populate default configuration files.
You can also view results after running a simulation.

**Optional - Run test suite:**

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest -q
```

This suite runs many unit tests of the chemistry and could take many minutes.

## Main python scripts to act as Entry Points

- **`run_mbm.py`**: Primary CLI runner for simulations.
- **`MBM_extractor.py`**: Tools to extract and summarise simulation outputs.
- **`model_tools/`**: R scripts and plotting utilities for downstream analysis.
- **`run_mbm_ui.py`**: Starts the simple UI front-end (see `UI/`).

## Configuring the simulation

All settings are defined or referenced in `run_mbm.py`.
You can edit this file to change global settings, or reference a different folder for the building configuration.

Alternatively you can change the building configuration in place by editing the JSON files in `config_rooms/`.

- [config_rooms/building.json](config_rooms/building.json)
- [config_rooms/room_1.json](config_rooms/room_1.json)

The configuration files reference initial concentrations from files such as [initial_concentrations.txt](initial_concentrations.txt).

**Overview of `config_rooms` JSON files**

The `config_rooms/` folder contains two JSON schemes: a building-level file that references room files, and per-room files with physical and schedule parameters. Times are given in seconds from simulation start.

- Building-level (`config_rooms/building.json`):
	- `rooms`: mapping of room name → room JSON path (e.g., "room 1": "config_rooms/room_1.json").
	- `wind`: object with `values` (array of `{time, speed, direction}`) and an `in_radians` boolean.
	- `apertures`: list of aperture descriptors `{origin, destination, area}` that connect rooms or external faces.
	- `initial_conditions`: mapping of room name → initial concentrations file path.
	- Example: [config_rooms/building.json](config_rooms/building.json)

- Room-level (`config_rooms/room_*.json`) common fields:
	- `volume_in_m3`: room air volume.
	- `surf_area_in_m2`: total surface area for deposition/uptake calculations.
	- `light_type`, `glass_type`: descriptive strings controlling photolysis/lighting settings.
	- `composition`: object listing surface-material percentages (e.g., `paint`, `wood`, `metal`, ...) that sum to ~100.
	- `temp_in_kelvin`, `rh_in_percent`, `airchange_in_per_second`: each uses an array of `[time, value]` pairs describing piecewise schedules.
	- `light_switch`: schedule of on/off values as  `[time, value]` pairs.
	- `emissions`: mapping species → emission schedule. Each species entry contains a `values` array; values may be bracketed segments: `{start, end, value}` describing emission bursts.
	- `n_adults`, `n_children`: occupancy schedules in `[time, value]` arrays.

For a description of any of the parameters local to a single room see the [INCHEM-Py](https://github.com/DrDaveShaw/INCHEM-Py/) documentation.

**Chemical Mechanism `fac` files**

Chemical mechanism files (FAC format) live in `chem_mech/`; one is selected in the global settings of `run_mbm.py`. 
Example files:

- [chem_mech/mcm_v331.fac](chem_mech/mcm_v331.fac)
- [inchempy/mcm_v331.fac](inchempy/mcm_v331.fac)

These are used by the chemistry modules  of inchempy for building reaction systems.
For details about `fac` files see the [INCHEM-Py](https://github.com/DrDaveShaw/INCHEM-Py/) documentation.


## Project Structure

- **`multiroom_model/`**: Core model classes and simulation engine (room definitions, transport, evolvers).
- **`chem_mech/`**: Chemical mechanism files (FAC format) used by the chemistry engine.
- **`inchempy/`**: This is an empty folder; choose a (compatible) version of inchempy and paste it here before running.
- **`config_rooms/`**: Building and room JSON configurations (`building.json`, `room_*.json`).
- **`model_tools/`**: R scripts and plotting utilities for downstream analysis.

## Overview of Key Classes and workings in `multiroom_model`

Below is a brief map of the principal classes you will encounter in `multiroom_model` and what they do. Refer to the source files for fuller docstrings and method details.

- `Simulation`: Coordinates the overall simulation (time loop, per-timestep updates, I/O) and advances species states across rooms and apertures.
- `GlobalSettings`: Stores simulation-wide defaults and global parameters used by the simulation and JSON builders.
- `RoomChemistry`: Holds chemistry-related options for a single room (mechanism selection, photolysis configuration, emissions).
- `InChemPyInstance` / `RoomInchemPyEvolver`: Encapsulate settings and factory methods to build and run InChemPy simulations (parsing FAC files, setting time steps, generating chemistry results).
- `Aperture`: Represents a connection between two rooms and stores properties used for flow calculations.
- `ApertureCalculation`, `ApertureFlowCalculator`, `Fluxes`: Compute advection and exchange flows through apertures and translate those into concentration fluxes between rooms.
- `TransportPath`: Models composite routes through multiple apertures along which continuous wind can flow.
- `WindDefinition`: The speed and direction of the wind changing over time.
- JSON builder/parsers: `BuildingJSONParser`, `ApertureJSONBuilder`, `RoomChemistryJSONBuilder`, `WindJsonBuilder`, and `GlobalSettingsJSONBuilder` — these parse the JSON configuration files in `config_rooms/` and construct the corresponding model objects.

Use these classes as starting points when extending or instrumenting the model; most heavy lifting is done in `simulation.py`, the evolver classes, and the aperture/flow calculators.
